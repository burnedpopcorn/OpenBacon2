OpenBacon
	A Bacon2 Decompilation
		by burnedpopcorn180
	
GameMaker Version Used: 2024.8
	
Uses Scribble 8.2, Mr Unown's FMOD Wrapper and Collisions, Gameframe, RT Shell

Probably my best Decomp to date, since I organized them myself without stealing it
And I manually checked all code (Objects and Sprites)
Plus Enums!

The Audio related Crashes from the original build are still here, but you can simply just remove them

As a warning, neither this Decompiler nor UnderAnalyzer are perfect.
There's likely gonna be some stuff you're gonna have to fix on your own.
