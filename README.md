# OpenBacon2
A Decompilation of the leaked Bacon2 build (and the FMOD Project as well)

GameMaker Version Used: ```2024.8.1.171```

> [!NOTE]
> I have made a decompilation of the cafetest1 build [here](https://github.com/burnedpopcorn/OpenBacon2-Updated)
> 
> That build is much more recent, so consider using that one instead

### ABOUT
This Decompilation is Completely Organized, and All code has been reviewed but not modified

So any Crashes or Issues from the original leaked build has NOT been fixed
<br>
But you should be able to fix them if you're really gonna use this for something

### Uh, FMOD Project?
also Yeah, the FMOD Project is also Included
<br>
No, it's not leaked

Thanks to my and CatMateo's [FMOD Decompiler](https://github.com/stuttermess/FMOD-Decompiler/), the full FMOD Project is yours to edit and mess around with
<br>
so have fun with it

ALSO
<br>
If you want to use GMSound rather than FMOD, then [check out this branch](https://github.com/burnedpopcorn/OpenBacon2/tree/GMSound-Port), which makes those changes and more!
